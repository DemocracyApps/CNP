  <h1>Collections vs Connections</h1>
  <br>

  <p>We have <em>1,347</em> stories. We can count them, list them, do statistics on them.</p>

  <p> --- Maybe here have a list of stories, paginated. Ideally from our simulated civic example</p>

  <p>But take them through a short sequence of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with a visual of just the stories ... text ... no structure, no organization</li>
    <li>What those stories consist of - break down into the component parts</li>
    <li>But there's more! Talk about the number of relationships - within and between stories</li>
    <li>Show them a visualization of the full network</li>
    <li>Next button at end to take them to the same link as "Potential of the graph" in the nav menu</li>
  </ul>
