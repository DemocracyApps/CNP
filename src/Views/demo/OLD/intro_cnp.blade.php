  <h1>What is the Community Narratives Platform?</h1>
  <br>

  <h4>A storytelling and collaborative sense-making platform for communities that builds on three foundational ideas:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Connections, Not Collections</b> <br>Move beyond posts and comments and discussions. Unlock the structure within traditionally unstructured data. In fact, stories are about structure and context. Focus on the rich relationships in and between a community's stories. </li>
    <li><b>Easy In, Easy Out</b><br>To scale, show up <em>in the stream</em> of people's normal activities and maintain focus on simplicity of use.</li>
    <li><b>Catalyze the Unexpected</b><br>Let citizens pose and answer and have others answer questions that we don't know to ask so we can learn the things we don't know we don't know.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>The CNP is intended to help communities learn about themselves, tell about themselves, and decide about their futures. Applications include:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Community Self-Discovery</li>
      <li>Community Planning</li>
      <li>Community Engagement</li>    
      <li>Journalism - Reporting and Reader Engagement</li>
      <li>Journalism - Information Gathering</li>
      <li>Surveys</li>
      <li>Crowd-Sourced Problem-Solving</li>
  </ul>
