  <h1>What Are We Talking About?</h1>


<p>One part insight, one part people, one part technology.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Insight</b> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Stories are the primary way we understand our world - what it is and what it could be</li>
            <li>Shared and interconnected stories are the foundation of our sense of community</li>
            <li>Stories are a way that even the least sophisticated can convey complex, rich information</li>
            <li>People can even help us analyze their stories by answering questions about them </li>
        </ul>
    <li><b>People</b>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no magic here. We need:</li>
            <li> A government truly interested in listening and learning</li>
            <li> Citizens anxious to share their concerns and ideas</li>
            <li> Civic organizations and media willing to play their parts</li>
        </ul>
    <li><b>Technology</b>
        <ul>
            <li>We are building a storytelling and collaborative sense-making platform<br>
                that facilitates engagement with a community through stories</li>
        </ul>

  </ul>
