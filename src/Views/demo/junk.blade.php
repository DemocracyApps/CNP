  <h1>Engagement Process</h1>
  <br>
<h4> There are three phases in a cycle that the CNP is designed to facilitate (not do on its own)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Gather</b> <br>Make it easy for people to engage by telling stories and answering questions about them in the context of their normal lives.  </li>
    <li><b>Curate</b><br>Make it easy for people to see the trends and outliers in the collected stories, as well to let serendipity work. Give them tools to tell about what they've found.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Make it easy to find things</li>
      <li>Let people save what they find so they can refer to it</li>
      <li>Let people say something about it</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Share</b><br>Make it really easy to share your own stories and others, especially outside the platform.</li>
  </ul>
