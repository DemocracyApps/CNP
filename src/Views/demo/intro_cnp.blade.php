  <h1>What is the Community Narratives Platform?</h1>
  <br>

  <p>A storytelling and collaborative sense-making platform for communities that builds on three foundational ideas:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Connections, Not Collections</b> <br>Focus on the rich internal structure, context and interrelationships of a community's stories. Move beyond posts and comments and discussions.</li>
    <li><b>Easy In, Easy Out</b><br>To scale, show up <em>in the stream</em> and focus on simplicity</li>
    <li><b>Catalyze the Unexpected</b><br>Let citizens pose and answer and have others answer questions that we don't know to ask so we can learn the things we don't know we don't know</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Help communities learn about themselves, tell about themselves, and decide about their futures</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Community Self-Discovery</li>
      <li>Community Planning</li>
