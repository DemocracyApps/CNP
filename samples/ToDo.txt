ToDo.txt

1. Change 'tag' in specifications to 'id'.
2. Change 'type' to 'inputType'
3. Figure out if 'element' is just class or also match. Needs to be clarified and 
   probably separated.
4. Add a way to specify conversionType or something so that Tag goes to multiple tags. 
   Or maybe make it a function of the Element type
