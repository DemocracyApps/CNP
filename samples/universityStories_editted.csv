Anerocia, where on denies themselves the right to eat, you starve yourself to and when you try  check yourself in the mirror even when skinning you still see yourself as fat, then still starve yourself to death. Theres also Bullmia, it catches the person who tries to slim but wont stop eating. You eat like it's the last time to eat then you realise oops I was saposed to ration my amount and you end up forcing yourself to puke because of guilt, you live with guilt for the rest of your life.

The country itself is amazing but the community at Los Patojos is what has changed my life.   During my first visit to Los Patojos we were tasked with painting a mural to bring art to the city of Jocotenango. We began awkwardly with the ambassadors in one corner and the Los Patojos kids in the other, like boys and girls at a middle school dance. The words &#8220;Los Patojos"" and &#8220;JustWorld&#8221; were neatly outlined and ready to be painted, however, the process quickly disintegrated into chaos when someone came up with the idea to put handprints on the mural.  Painted hands quickly led to painted faces and clothing and laughter so hard that my stomach ached by the end of the day.   Another day, some of the ambassadors and Los Patojos students climbed to the roof of the project overlooking the town of Jocotenango.  We looked out over the violent streets of their city with the barbed wire that topped the grey cinderblock and rusted sheet metal buildings.  We discussed the problems that plague their daily lives.  Despite the obstacles these kids face, they remained optimistic. Melly wants to go to a university next year to study media and broadcasting, Frank is learning english to work in tourism and Angel wants to educate the next generation to help give them the opportunities that Los Patojos has provided him.  They all told me that without Los Patojos they would never have these opportunities or these dreams.

These lessons and workshops have helped me become confident in my abilities, aware of myself and my community and empowered me to be a giving, not just a taking member of my community.  This is the only community center of it's kind in Tulkarem. Most of the members of our center go on to attend international and local cross-border youth leadership, cultural exchange, communication and peace programs. Since 2007, there have been about 150 of our youth who have attended a program. There are also about 50 adults, including my mom, who have gotten involved as well. These programs include: Encompass Trust-Uk, Hands of Peace, Seeds of Peace, Building Bridges, Play in the Wild, Vacation from War, Creativity for Peace, UWC Arava Valley course, Friends of the Earth Middle East, Week of the World-Italy, Baram Salam, Windows for Peace and more.  In our center we are free to speak our minds and have opinions that are different from everyone elses. Gender is not an issue, neither is being popular or unpopular. Everyone has a voice and is encouraged to use it.   We celebrate birthdays, graduations and holidays together. We are a family. Even when some of our members go to university or move away for jobs, they always come back to visit and even give us workshops in whatever it is they have learned during their time at the center or in programs. We have learned from Mrs. Karen that it is important to give back and to share the opportunities we have had with the rest of our community.  The lives of everyone who has participated at our center has been enriched in some some way. Some more than other, but that depended on how much the person wanted to benefit from what is offered, and how much they wanted to share.  I am now participating in my second program through Mrs. Karen's center. The first was a local program called UWC Arava Valley, which was an international environmental course near Eilat. Now I am in Hands of Peace with 3 of my other community center members. Actually, our community center has the most representatives at this program, than anyplace else in the West Bank.

That time I have no conceptual clarity about developmental issues. But gradually I learnt to work with different organizations. When this project expired I joined another organization to make a good career in this development sector and with continue struggle I worked with different NGOs and INGOs in different capacities till 2005. In 2006, I joined ""Shehersaaz"" as National Coordinator and voluntary basis I continue my struggle. In between, I did many consultancies to run myself and the organizational matters. This organization was established in 2002 by students of Engineering University, Lahore, Pakistan and registered under Trust Act of 1882 of Pakistan. They also make a separate official account. But when I joined, there was not a single penny in the account. I resigned from my last job and joined Shehersaaz. It was quite challenging and difficult task for me.Then, I started to develop links with Islamabad based organizations working on similar  issues. Fortunately, Shehersaaz received assignment to conduct  training programs on health and hygiene issues and designing of IEC material. It was not huge money, but alt-least it covered organizational expenditures. In the same year, we received a research study from Action-aid Pakistan. It was 2 months assignment but it also covered our basic expenditures. Then there was no work. After one year, we received another research grant at international level. This small grant make us as stand-able position. We hired 2 persons on salary but still I worked as volunteer in organization. But this whole work could not make any strong background in specific field. In this span of time, I applied to different organization for funding, but always received ""Regret"". This made me hopeless, but I continue my struggle and try to find out new ways. Because for the survival of the organization, I started consultancies, next 3 years I did but it became difficult to manage; to run office or job simultaneously. But this sacrifice could not make any strong experience and background of the organization, expect this, that organization is present or in working condition. In 2010, one consultancy organization offered me a job. I worked there for 1 year,e but Shehersaaz's work become ignored so I resigned there and again joined Shehersaaz. In 2011, again I started to apply in different for funding but no response. With this whole set-up I got disturbed, no work, no hopes, situation become worst that how to run the basic expenditures of the organization. Next one year Shehersaaz had no funding, it become very difficult to manage. In 2012, I thought, why not to start to celebrate UN designated days with those organizations who are working on same issues. Then 1st time in 2012, we celebrated ""River Day"" with Action-aid Pakistan. Then we save some money to run for at-least 1 month. It was good experience because relationship and liaison building was started to develop with organization and know that few organizations has some small amount in reserve that they can give for these sort of celebrations.  So from onward, we started to celebrate, World Water Day, Word Environment Day, National & International Disaster Day. These celebrations provided us some cushions. But one side of the organization left grey, that we always faced, experience, background, handling the major finances. Still we are facing. In 2013, we launched an environmental campaign ""An Amal"" mean ""Just Action"" with support of public participation. The concept was highly appreciated and people started to become a member of our campaign, Now we have 600 members, they contributed just 3US$ a year & we give a cotton bag to reduce the use and give them alternate. These bags manufactured by home-based female workers. Demand of this project is now increasing, we have not sufficient money to continue. We have ideas but lack of financial resources. We made cotton bags for three organizations, & we received good response from them. We have now good relationship with them, as they committed to give some work in future for bag making but not for the project, as they said ""you have no sound background to implement that project.  In end I will, donors/organizations should trust us, that we can do, & we can prove. They always shatter our confidence.","Small Acts, Big Impacts",Plan International,,Paksitan,Islamabad,Nill,,Female,Was affected by what happened,The right people,428096395,Yes,101437074,,Indifferent,Creativity,82,,,,,31-45,,,,"2,3,4,6,7,8,10,11,28,12,18,13,22,19,21,23,24,25,26,27,34,35,36,15,14,16,1",67317Plan Uganda this organisation provided school fees to mu two junior sisters which helped them to finish secondary education and joined Kyambogo university for their degree courses,helping needy children to acquire education,plan uganda,"degree, junior, finish, secondary, university",uganda,luwero,kasanai,1-2 years ago,Female,Was affected by what happened,The right people,810460815,Yes,882877995,<<30-11-2011-CEPO-S#070-P#01>>_,Hopeful,"Security,Family and Friends,Physical Needs",94,Good idea that succeeded,Mixed,Mixed,Mixed,22-30,0.84917,32.47306,Plan International,"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,122,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,23,37,38,39,40,132,133,134",38367"Ndegeya Primary Teachers Institution admits each and everyone who has qualified,it is under the government control.I t surrenders free education to the people which enable them who have  no money to join the university also to receive certificate as qualified teachers.",SETTING UP FREE EDUCATION BY THE GOVERNMENT,PRIMARY TEACHERS INSTITUTION,,UGANDA,MASAKA,MASAKA TOWN,Less than 2 months ago,Male,Saw it happen,The wrong people,460416525,No,,[HORIZON]2011-07-12-KACHEERA SACCO-S#367-P#01>>_,Important,"Family and Friends,Physical Needs,Freedom",,Good idea that succeeded,Mixed,Mixed,Mixed,22-30,-0.5,31.75,No Answer,"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,122,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,23,37,38,39,40,132,133,134",8475"My uncle a wealthy and very known man in my community was always in pains and bitterness whenever he thought of his son who was very stressful stubborn and a person with no respect for his father and elderly and that made him do this because of his father's wealth.

He completed his high school education in 2006 and obtained  a mean grade of B-(minus) in the Kenyan Secondary School Exam. Due his family's economic situation he was unable to accept an offer to pursue a degree at Egerton University in Kenya. His parents were not able to support his university education unless his sisters dropped out of high school. Many young people in his community faced the same challenge. As a result many had to join the workforce right after high school abandoning their aspirations of further education.   Oscar knew about Tana River Life Foundation as it has been sponsoring students in his community. He approached Mr. Gabriel Teo, the founder, and asked for assistance with his university fees. He was accepted into the Youth Formation Program run by the foundation. The program is a pay forward scheme designed to prepare students from rural areas for tertiary education. It exposes them to challenges they will meet in cities and coaches them on how to overcome them. This ensures that the students understand what they want in life and would not be easily distracted by the lights of the city while living away from home pursuing their higher education. During that period, Oscar coached primary and high school students in their studies through a special tuition program.   As part of the formation program he was trained in different areas of leadership, taught to be responsible as well mentored on living a life of honesty and integrity. After the program he was accepted by Univerisiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) in Malaysia to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Systems.  Having just completed his degree, Oscar is looking forward to his first job and contributing to my family and community. He is the first in his family to complete a university education.   Oscar believes that TRLF has contributed immensely to the Tana River community as it assists students from different rural backgrounds. It has been instrumental in building infrastructure to many high schools in the region as well as providing facilities like books and study aids to students. Having being part of a group of more than 500 students beneficiaries, he truly feels it has brought hope to many students who could have been denied an opportunity of having a good career ahead.",Oscar Raha Graduates from University,Tana River Life Foundation,,Kenya,Tana Delta,Idsowe,,Male,Was affected by what happened,The right people,714688590,No,,,Happy,"Knowledge, Respect, Self-esteem",,,,,,22-30,,,,"2,3,4,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,20,21,26,27,29,33,1",67219"Through its servises, this organisation helped a collegue, who is HIV positive.

Nearly 4 years ago I went to our local church with information about the situation of the Palestinian people...since the church is a Christian community I began with the reality of life in Bethlehem!! Their knowledge of the little town was way out of date. I told them about the work of Amos Trust and Garth Hewitt.. I worked with their mission committee and won approval to develop a program during the season of Lent...4 weeks..we met..I invited several speakers..a minister, a Jewish doctor, an academic..who all spoke of their learned knowledge of the situation between Israel/Palestine. The Presbyterian Church USA has a study guide called "" Steadfast Hope"" .  we watched several segments on the DVD that comes with the study guide.  Thus about 15 members of this community were able to get information they do not get on the mainstream news!!!  I sold olive oil from Canaan Fair Trade.  I believe that a couple folks form this community were representatives to the Presbyterian ( PC-USA) General Assembly this June in Detroit. By a margin of only 7 votes, the PC USA General Assembly voted to divest from Caterpillar, Motorola Solution and Hewlitt Packard - 3 American corporations that have been profiting from the Occupation policies of the Israeli government.  companies that make the settlement enterprise possible..The vote of this large Christian denomination was picked up by the major news outlets, thus getting the attention of the American public.!! I truly believe that the awareness created by individuals taking the time to reach out and bring the reality, the history and reality of the military Occupation and human rights violations leads other individuals to see the moral bankruptcy of the Occupation and those who would sustain it.  By joining with others involved in peace and human rights, one's network of contact grows...creating even more opportunities to connect.  Because of Karen Abuzant 's program in Tulkarem - the Peaceful Community program - and her vision and ability to connect the youth of the community with the outside world, they have some opportunities to experience the reality of life outside the Occupation.  Four of her students were able to travel to North Carolina and attend a camp that employs creative activities that promote skillful communication and strategies for the work of non violence.  Since I am a volunteer for peace, justice and human rights, I was contacted through my network about the program here and a small organization I support was able to help bring representative youth from Peaceful community to attend the program.l  I was delighted to meet the 4 young people from Tulkarem and also introduce them to a doctor on the medical staff of the University of Nroth Carolina...a surgeon who travels to the West Bank with others to correct congenital conditions of cleft palate.! We are changing the perceptions of people here in America...I regret that it is so slow.  I also regret that our government has powerful lobbies - like the military industrial complex- that influence foreign policy more than we do.  Yet we press on!.  The peace and human rights members of the grassroots communities both here and in the Wet Bank are making connections and educating the youth - ours and theirs -  to build a better future, a more hopeful and peaceful future, and one more secure for the human rights of all. That is so hard to do under the oppression of Occupation and under the dominant narrative that denies them opportunities to tell their story.

The ideas for each business we create come from the community and the funding each business receives is at least in part funded by community business owners and leaders. In fact building this community support is what leads to our programs success.   USAID once we had reached the stage of creating the projects changed the program to dictate what businesses the women could create and would not allow community support for the businesses transforming in essence what we do and forcing the local market to become over saturated with businesses it did not need (there are only so many wood making, tailoring and beads making shops one community can sustain).   We eventually had to back out because we felt the assistance we would be offering young women within Namibia would lead to more community problems than it would solve.   USAID said the reason we had to work within their framework was because that is what the US government dictated the community needed and any deviation from it would not be funded.
