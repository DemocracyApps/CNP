    	 * The simplest thing is just a linear sequence of inputs that map to elements.
    	 * However, we can then begin to add complications:
    	 *   - Provide a "next" link
    	 *   - Provide a set of "next" links that depend on the person's input
    	 *   - Create input elements that appear if some previous input has a particular value
    	 */
    	/*
    	 * For the auto-interactive input type, the map is just a sequence of individual input specifications.
    	 * By default, we'll just put them on a page, one after another, followed at the end by a "Submit" button.
    	 *
    	 * Paging occurs in 2 ways. First is simple to insert a pagebreak element. The second is to do any kind
    	 * of computed next link, in which case we can't know what comes next until the user answers. That will also
    	 * automatically generate a page break.
